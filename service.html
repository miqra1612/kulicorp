Many of these buildings were preserved for posterity and converted to new uses, others upgraded and given a new lease of life that will allow for them to continue being part of Singapore landscape. From buildings with significant historical values, Kuli Corp has moved rapidly forward over the years with technology advancements and involved ourselves wholeheartedly in building state-of-the-art landmarks and buildings.
